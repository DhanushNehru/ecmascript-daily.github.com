ECMAScript adopt new terminology that is "Agents".
Shared memory proposal(Stage 3) require to define "agents".

> The purpose is to get rid of the agents proposal by splitting it in two: this part as a PR - because it largely bundles up what is in E262 already, though some of it is unstated - and the other part goes back into the shared memory proposal.
